## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **2nd-year Artificial Intelligence student** at Szabist University  with a strong interest in **data science, data analysis, and beginner-level machine learning**.  
I am currently building a solid foundation in **Python, statistics, and machine learning concepts** through structured learning and hands-on practice.

I enjoy working with data to extract insights, understand patterns, and explore how intelligent systems are built using real-world data.  
My goal is to grow into a **data-driven AI professional** with strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
